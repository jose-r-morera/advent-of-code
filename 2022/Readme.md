# 2022 Advent of Code
This year I will be solving the challenges with C++, a language I already have some knowledge on, as I have little spare time.

## ChatGPT usage
However, I wanted to use this event to try something new. **After finishing** each daily puzzle, I will try to solve them again using Open's AI chatGPT.

I will upload these results to the folder "AI". For each challenge, two files will be uploaded: a `AI_dayXX_partX.cpp` containing the code generated, and a `AI_dayXX_queries.md` with the full transcript of my conversation with the AI for the code obtained.
